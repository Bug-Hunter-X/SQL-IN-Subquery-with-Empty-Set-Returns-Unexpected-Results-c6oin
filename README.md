# SQL IN Subquery with Empty Set Bug
This repository demonstrates a common SQL bug related to using the `IN` operator with subqueries that might return an empty result set. The issue leads to unexpected behavior where no rows are returned, even when other conditions in the `WHERE` clause should yield results.

The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous SQL query.  The `bugSolution.sql` file provides a corrected version that addresses the issue, ensuring correct behavior even when subqueries produce empty sets.

## Problem
When a subquery in an `IN` clause returns no rows, the entire condition becomes false, possibly resulting in an empty result set. This behavior is counterintuitive when other parts of the `WHERE` clause suggest that rows should be selected.

## Solution
The solution involves using `EXISTS` or `LEFT JOIN` instead of `IN` to handle cases where the subquery might return an empty set.  These alternatives provide more robust and predictable behavior.
